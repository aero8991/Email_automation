# Email_automation

The python files in here use win32.com's ability to connect directly with Microsoft Office and are designed to be used as templates. 

I built these scripts with the intention of searching though an inbox, locating an email and then converting the contents to a dataframe using python Pandas. 

I've added an email feature that has the capibilities of notifcation to a user or users via wind32com's Dispatch. 

Please note, its recommended that the user will need to have an active Microsoft Office account.
